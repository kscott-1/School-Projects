# School-Projects
Code and PDF outputs from various school projects included in this repository. There is a lot of content here so if there is a constraint on how much you would like to look at, read the following:

The project which showcases the most skills is titled "finalprojectreport.Rmd" with the corresponding pdf titled "finalprojectreport.pdf" done at the end of the Fall Semester 2021. (This is an individual project, all work was 100% done by me)

There are some group projects and group presentations on here. If there is anything in particular on these that you are curious if I myself did, please reach out. I'm happy to explain any of it.
